# pandas-challenge
This is a repository for the DU pandas challenge

In PyCitySchools you will find two folders and jupyter notebook.

The analysis folder contains a documtent taking a detatiled look at the findings from the project and a recomendation of potential next steps for the district. The resources folder contains two CSV files that hold the raw data for the students and the schools in the district.

When run, the jupyter notebook analyses the CSV files giving basis to the claims and findings made in the analysis document.
